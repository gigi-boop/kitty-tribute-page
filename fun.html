                        <p>As anyone who has ever been around a cat for any length of time well knows, cats have enormous patience with the limitations of the humankind.</p>

                        <p>Of all Godâ€™s creatures, there is only one that cannot be made slave of the lash. That one is the cat. If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve the man, but it would deteriorate the cat.</p>

                        <p>In its flawless grace and superior self-sufficiency I have seen a symbol of the perfect beauty and bland impersonality of the universe itself, objectively considered, and in its air of silent mystery there resides for me all the wonder and fascination of the unknown</p>
